            <center> Greetings dear friends</center>
            <p>Soccer has always been my favorite sport to watch rather than to play due to my limitations,
                and this liking has first started when i was 14 years old and my brother is 18, who is a huge fan
                of one of the popular players and most arguably G.O.A.T in soccer. and he introduced me to this amazing
                team-based sport where every player matters. <br/>  After that point we used to watch lots of matches
                together and understand how well a good managed team can perform and how a single player can also make
                a difference some times.<br>More about my favorite player can be found here: 
            </p>
